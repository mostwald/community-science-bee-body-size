## Leveraging community science to measure bee body size from museum specimens

### Abstract

Community or volunteer participation in research has important potential to mobilize the wealth of biodiversity and functional ecological data housed in natural history collections. Many such projects recruit community scientists to transcribe specimen label data from images; a further step would be to task community scientists with conducting straightforward morphological measurements (e.g., body size) from specimen images. We investigated whether community science could be an effective approach to generating large body size datasets from specimen images generated by museum digitization initiatives. Using the community science platform Notes from Nature, we engaged community scientists in a specimen measurement task to estimate body size (i.e., intertegular distance) from images of bee specimens. Community scientists showed high engagement and completion of this task, with each user measuring 43.6 specimens on average and self-reporting that could successfully measure 98.0% of the images. Community scientist measurements were significantly larger than measurements conducted by trained researchers, though the average measurement error was only 2.3%. These results suggest that community science participation could be an effective approach for bee body size measurement, for descriptive studies or for research questions where this degree of expected error is deemed acceptable. For larger-bodied organisms (e.g., vertebrates), where small measurement errors represent a smaller proportion of body size, community science approaches may be particularly effective. These methods may serve as a blueprint for future projects aimed at engaging community scientists in biodiversity and collections-based research through trait measurement.
